# Final Data Science Project: [Food Recipes Dashboard](https://abdusshh-vscode-project-foodrecipes-dataprojectdashboard-abv0ix.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains my homeworks for Python for Data Science course.
This project helped me learn basic data science, important Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, bokeh, streamlit, etc. and VS Code's source control features.
