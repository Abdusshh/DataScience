st.write("Based on the research on cuisines and diets, the findings suggest that there is no significant correlation between cooking time and rating. This indicates that the length of time it takes to cook a dish is not a determining factor in how well it is rated. Other factors, such as the quality of ingredients, cooking technique, and personal taste preferences, may play a more significant role in determining how well a dish is received. It's important to consider these factors when evaluating the success of a cuisine or diet and to focus on creating dishes that appeal to a broad range of tastes and preferences.")

st.markdown("### Why is average rating of cuisines and diets important?")
st.write("""The average user rating of certain cuisines or diets is another important piece of data that can be incredibly useful for those interested in exploring new flavors and cuisines. By knowing the average rating of different cuisines or diets, you can get a sense of which dishes are particularly popular and highly regarded by others. This can help you identify recipes that are likely to be delicious, and that will appeal to your own personal tastes and preferences. 
        \n Additionally, the average user rating of certain cuisines or diets can help you discover new recipes and dishes that you may not have otherwise considered. By looking for highly rated recipes in a particular cuisine or diet, you can expand your culinary horizons and explore new flavors and ingredients that you may not have tried before. 
        \n Another important benefit of knowing the average user rating of certain cuisines or diets is that it can help you avoid recipes that are likely to be disappointing or not worth your time and effort. By looking for recipes with high ratings, you can be more confident that you are investing your time and resources into a dish that is likely to be delicious and well-received by your family and friends. 
        \n In conclusion, the average user rating of certain cuisines or diets is a valuable piece of data that can help you discover new recipes, explore new flavors, and avoid recipes that are likely to be disappointing. Whether you are a seasoned cook or a novice in the kitchen, this data can help you make the most of your culinary adventures and ensure that every meal you prepare is delicious and satisfying.""")
